      <h3>Born in Argentina,</h3>
	  <p>becoming the youngest of 2 siblings. At age 7 we moved to Mexico City, where we lived for 8 years.</p>
	  <h3>During those years,</h3>
	  <p>we went to school made up with kids from all over the world. To this day I'm incredibly grateful for everything that experience brought.</p> 
	  <h3>When I finished highschool,</h3>
	  <p>I signed up for a Marketing major.</p>
	  <h3>At 22 I started working in Zurich,</h3>
	  <p>in the International Programs team.</p>
	  <h3>After turning 23 I moved out on my own,</h3>
	  <p>as did my closest friends. Surprisingly enought we all ended up living within a 2 block radius for 3 years.</p>
	  <h3>In 2013 I left Zurich to work elsewhere for 2 years,</h3>
	  <p>and ended up meeting my husband.</p>
	  <h3>2 years ago</h3>
	  <p>We got married. The planner messed up the seating arrangements and the priest who was supposed to perform the ceremony bailed on us. We learned that people much rather prefer choosing where to sit down, and that it wise to have a friend with a spare priest on speedial.</p>
   	  <h3>Last year</h3>
	  <p>I quit smoking after 14 years.</p>
	  <h3>Now,</h3>
	  <p>I juggle between a long list of goals and plans for the upcoming years. I want to remodel our apartment, take cooking classes, learn an additional language and travel as much as I can. And Running. I want to take up Running even though I'm terrible at it.</p>
